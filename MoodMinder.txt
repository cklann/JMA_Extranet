6/1/2013 11:20:00 AM, Energetic, Event-driven, Level 5, I don't like "Newsroom" but I'll listen to this program because Terry Gross is asking interesting questions.
6/3/2013 1:00:00 PM, Relaxed, Self-generated, Level 6, I think everything is in control for this deal that is closing Monday. We should be in good shape.
6/5/2013 3:00:00 PM, Bored, Self-generated, Level 1, I'm sick of work today. I'm tired. It's boring. What else do I have to get done before I can get out here?
6/7/2013 5:00:00 PM, Bored, Event-driven, Level 2, Driving home from work. Here I go. Hopefully traffic isn't terrible.
6/9/2013 8:00:00 PM, Depressed, Event-driven, Level 1, At the hospital visiting my brother's newborn in the intensive care unit. Poor thing. Just got into this world and already has to fight.
6/11/2013 3:00:00 PM, Frustrated, Event-driven, Level 1, I rarely take naps, and now that I do, the neighbors decide to be loud?
6/13/2013 3:30:00 PM, Relaxed, Self-generated, Level 4, What should I do now?
6/15/2013 12:00:00 PM, Engaged, Self-generated, Level 3, OK, I'll finish this task, shower and then head out.
6/17/2013 12:00:00 PM, Content, Self-generated, Level 6, Nice night out
6/28/2013 12:00:00 PM, Focused, Self-generated, Level 3, Productive day so far.  What's next?
6/21/2013 12:00:00 PM, Content, Self-generated, Level 5, What's the game plan for today?
6/23/2013 12:00:00 PM, Engaged, Self-generated, Level 5, I know what I want to do today; how do I fit it all in?
6/26/2013 12:00:00 PM, Engaged, Self-generated, Level 3, Gotta work hard during this workout.
6/30/2013 12:00:00 PM, Annoyed, Event-driven, Level 2, Let me do this work just to get it out of the way.  It's ridiculous that they pretend to need this by Monday.
7/1/2013 12:00:00 PM, Frustrated, Event-driven, Level 2, We just talked. She knows to expect my call around now, yet she doesn't answer. And this jerk just cut in line.
7/3/2013 12:00:00 PM, Content, Self-generated, Level 4, I'm hungry. Looking forward to eating and then winding down tonight.
7/5/2013 12:00:00 PM, Engaged, Self-generated, Level 3, Haven't talked to this guy in a while. This is interesting.
7/7/2013 12:00:00 PM, Engaged, Event-driven, Level 2, I hope I don't set her off with anything I say.  Always unpredictable.
7/9/2013 12:00:00 PM, Content, Self-generated, Level 6, It's nice to go out for lunch instead of eating at my desk.
7/11/2013 12:00:00 PM, Grumpy, Self-generated, Level 1, I'm very tired today. Not enough sleep. I want to go home.
7/13/2013 12:00:00 PM, Annoyed, Self-generated, Level 2, Let me get this out of the way so that I can get out of here.
7/15/2013 12:00:00 PM, Pessimistic, Self-generated, Level 1, It takes too much time to unwind and get to bed.
7/17/2013 12:00:00 PM, Annoyed, Event-driven, Level 3, I'll help this person, even though they didn't bother to include a "please" in their request. And it's not part of my job to help with this stuff anyway. Rude.
7/19/2013 12:00:00 PM, Bored, Event-driven, Level 1, These people are not funny. I don't have anything in common with them.
7/21/2013 12:00:00 PM, Content, Event-driven, Level 3, This didn't end up too bad. Lunch started out boring, but got better near the end.
7/23/2013 12:00:00 PM, Engaged, Event-driven, Level 3, They'd better waive this fee. I won't argue, but this service is entirely replaceable.
7/25/2013 12:00:00 PM, Pessimistic, Event-driven, Level 2, I really hate this work. I don't trust the team, and this will not end well. I need to cover myself.
8/6/2013 3:04:41 PM, Happy, Event-driven, Level 3, Here are some sample thoughts.
8/7/2013 8:51:03 AM, Frustrated, Event-driven, Level 2, Here are some sample thoughts.
8/15/2013 10:46:21 AM, Frustrated, Self-generated, Level 2, I'm frustrated that this program isn't working.
